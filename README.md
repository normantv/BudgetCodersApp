# BudgetCodersApp
Final Project for EC327 "Intro to Software Engineering" at Boston University

The BudgetCoders Team was composed of: Norman Toro Vega, Justin Leszczynski, Chanapat Suksangium, Natapat Chotruchsakul, and Margot Bauman

This app was built as the project component of the EC327 Course at BU during the Fall 2018 Semester. It is focused on showcasing the technologies available in Android Studio and the use of Object Oriented Programming through the Java Programming Language. The app incentivizes users to save money by showing how much you have left until you reach a specified goal and offering a reward for successfully completing the goal. The project includes elements from Android Material Design Language (UI Components) and Apple's iOS Human Interface Guidelines (Colors).
